# The web frontend

The frontend is a page on your own machine that lists the runs under a folder and opens
each of them, so that you can look at a run without reading its files. It only reads: it
never writes to a run directory, starts or stops a campaign, or runs Acceptance.

## Install

The frontend's web service (FastAPI and uvicorn) comes with the optional `web` extra; a
campaign-only install does without it:

```bash
uv sync --extra web
```

The page itself is built and kept in the package, so no Node is needed to serve it. Only
changing the page needs Node 18 or newer: edit `frontend/`, then run
`npm ci && npm run build` there and commit the rebuilt `factor_agent/web/static/`.

## Start it

Point `factor-agent-web` at the folder that holds your run directories (the `run_dir` of
your configs), at any depth, or at a single run directory:

```bash
uv run factor-agent-web runs/
```

It serves the page on <http://127.0.0.1:8000>; `--port` picks another port. It listens on
localhost only and has no option to listen on another interface: the pages show your
prompts, code and statistics, and there is no login. Stop it with Ctrl-C.

The run list shows every run directory under the folder, the latest active first,
including one whose first round has not been written yet:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| run | the run directory's path under the folder |
| code version | the commit of quantlab-factor-agent the run was last started or resumed with |
| rounds | the rounds written so far |
| trials, accepted | the trials of those rounds, and how many were accepted |
| state | "stopped" with the campaign's reason, or "not stopped" while it runs or after a crash |
| last activity | when the run last wrote a file |

A round counts once the campaign has written it at the round's end; the round in progress
is not counted yet. Click a run to open it.

## The memory page

Every `round.memory_every` rounds the distiller folds the trials since its last version
into the memory that every later prompt carries (see {doc}`campaign`). The memory page
lists every version it wrote in the run, named by the round after which it was written,
the latest first and open. From the second version on, a version shows its lines beside
those of the version before: added lines are highlighted, removed ones struck through,
and "Text alone" shows the version as the prompts carry it. A version the distiller left
as it was says it is unchanged. A run whose distiller has not written a version yet says
so; an empty or unreadable distiller reply writes no version, and the memory before it is
kept.

## On a server

When the campaign runs on a server, start the frontend there and forward its port to your
laptop over SSH:

```bash
# on the server
uv run factor-agent-web /path/to/runs

# on your laptop
ssh -N -L 8000:localhost:8000 user@server.example.com
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000> on your laptop. The page is reachable only through your
SSH connection; nothing is served to the server's network.
